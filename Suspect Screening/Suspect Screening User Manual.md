- **Suspect Screening.py** is a Python script for seed molecule-guided oligomer screening and annotation for LC-MS data. 
- The program is publicly available at [https://github.com/FangLab/Oligomer-Finder/Suspect Screening.git](https://github.com/FangLab/Oligomer-Finder/Suspect%20Screening.git)
- Please see below for detailed instructions on using the **Suspect Screening.py** code:

### **Introduction**

An oligomer is a molecule that consists of a few repeating units. Polymer oligomers are a class of substances widely present in polymers. They are found to be released into food media and the environment due to degradation during the use and disposal of polymer products, which are harmful to human and environmental safety. The oligomers are complex because of their repeat units, chain length, and modified end groups.

**Suspect Screening** is a program developed as a supplement to **Oligomer-Finder** for seed molecule-guided screening and annotation of oligomers with a carbonâˆ’carbon (C-C) backbone in MS data.

**MS-DIAL** (http://prime.psc.riken.jp/compms/msdial/main.html) is used for the first treatment of MS data and supports multiple MS/MS instruments (MALDI-MS/MS, GC/MS/MS, and LC/MS/MS) and MS vendors (Agilent, Bruker, Sciex, Shimadzu, Thermo, and Waters).
